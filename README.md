# Websocket Demo

This is a quick demo to share how a multi-room websocket application could be designed with Go

## Pre-requirements

CGO is needed in order for this application to run, therefore please be sure that has been setup.

Starting the server is as simple as `go run .`. There are flags for **port** and **sqlite file location** which are `-p` and `-f` respectively. These are optional.
